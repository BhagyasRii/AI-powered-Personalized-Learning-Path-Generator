# AI-powered-Personalized-Learning-Path-Generator

#Project Overview
This AI agent dynamically generates personalized learning roadmaps for users based on their desired topics, time constraints, and expertise levels. It searches for high-quality learning resources, assigns weights based on relevance, and structures a roadmap for efficient knowledge acquisition.

Features & Functionality
- Automated Learning Path Generation: Creates structured roadmaps for AI and tech topics.
- Topic Dependency Mapping: Understands prerequisite and next-step topics.
- Resource Recommendation: Fetches courses, videos, and articles from platforms like Wikipedia, YouTube, and Coursera.
- Weighted Resource Ranking: Assigns importance based on difficulty and quality.
- Progress Tracking: Allows users to mark phases as complete.
- Visualization Dashboard: Displays roadmap, resource allocation, and learning progress.

How It Works
1. User inputs a learning topic (e.g., Machine Learning, Deep Learning).
2. The AI agent fetches relevant learning materials.
3. It structures a roadmap based on prerequisites, subtopics, and learning phases.
4. The user receives a visualized timeline and recommended resources.
5. Users track progress and explore trending GitHub projects.
